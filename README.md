MovieApp is a small app in Flutter and Dart that allows a user to input data about movies, actors and producers.
The app allows the user to view information about the movies by showing:

a) All the movies, with no classification or grouping
b) The movies the user deemed as favourite
c) All the movies, grouped by genre

If someone wishes to view informations about the actors they can either:
a) View info about all actors for which there is data about in the app
b) View only the actors that are deemed as 'favourite'
